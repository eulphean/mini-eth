# mini-eth

It's a tiny little Ethereum dev server with free ether and stuff. Blocks every 1 second with instant seal.

Here's the mnemonic you should use. The first 10 addresses will have hella ether.
```
emotion smile pigeon cargo usual mandate clever purse index moral false stairs
```

Don't use this mnemonic anywhere else, obviously.

```
make run
# then
make distribute
```
